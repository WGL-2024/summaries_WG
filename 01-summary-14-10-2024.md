30 WGL out of 30 were present at the meeting.
* The meeting started with an introduction and suggestion from the professor, about not
making this work a race to find who is the good and who is bad at programming, but rather a
cohesive group work.
* The WG then started to discuss the projectâ€™s protocols.
  1. Corrected some typo in the first page.
  2. Vote to decide if servers and clients could not be connected to other servers/clients;
Approved the limitation with 30 votes out of 30.
  3. Vote to decide if the drop probability range was 0-1 or 0-100;
Approved the probability range of 0-1 with 27 votes out of 30.
  4. Discussion about a possible cap of the probability rate, to limit the risk that a 100% PDR drone would bring. The leaders proposed their ideas and points, and the vote
was postponed to a following meeting.
  5. Discussion about sharing the group's code with other groups, turned down by the
professor, since against the course goal.
  6. Discussion about implementing the initializer to create more than 2 clients and
servers each; Vote postponed to a following meeting.
  7. Discussion about changing the nodes_ids length from 5 nodes to at least 10 in the
serialization, since 5 may not be enough to traverse the whole network to destination;
Vote postponed to a following meeting.
  8. Vote for the modification of the drone, client and server lines, adding between
drone_id/client_id/server_id and connected_drone_ids an integer value that indicates
how many connected drones it has; The vote result was 23 out of 30, approving the
change.
