At the meeting were present 28 out of 31 WGL. The WG consisted of the discussion of the pull requests posted on github during last week:

* The meeting started with a discussion about the server types, concluded with the of the proposal to have hybrid types, and using a more simple model composed of three distinct type. The decision passed with 26 votes in favor and 5 abstained.
* The second topic was about some changes in the servers' protocols for the comunication with clients. The changed were voted, and since the result was 8 votes in favor, 9 against, and 11 abstained, the subject will be postponed, and a better explanation will be required.
* The third proposal was about a refactorization of various files in the API with the scope of organizing and simplifying the use of some of the modules. The changes passed with 28 votes in favor.
* The fourth proposal was about an implementation of a Drone struct aimed to solve the problem of the adding of a new drone to the network, and consequentially the channels inside each drone.
* The fifth proposal was an example of implementation for a different Drone struct. This two proposal will be merged in a more API, leaving also an example of implementation available in a separate file, and will be voted on telegram before the next WGM.
* The sixth topic proposed changes to the query flooding, but since it was an implementation rather than an API, it was postponed and a new proposal on the topic will be required.
* The last topic was an updating of the Packet struct, adding Query and QueryResult to the types available inside the packet, and simplifying the Fragment struct. The first change passed with 28 votes in favor, while the second one passed with 26 votes in favor, 1 against and 1 abstained. The remeining part of the proposal will be postponed and a better proposal on the topic will be required.
